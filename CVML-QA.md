- [ ] What is the difference between image warping and distortion?
  - Image warping is any process that changes the shapes portrayed in an image. 
  A warp could be as simple as a stretch or a rotation, or it could be a complex distortion. 
  Nevertheless, the basic idea of warping is to relocate pixels in the input image to different positions in the output image. 
  - Image warping is high-level concept than distortion. It includes: geometric distortion (and other optical aberrations), noise,
  ,vigentting, color imbalances
  - Geometric distortion is commonly categorized into two forms: radial and tangential.
    - Radial
      - Caused by imperfect lenses, its focal length is not constant across the lens
      - Deviations are most noticeable for rays that pass through the edge of the lens
    - Tangential
      - Occurs when the lens and the image plane are not parallel
