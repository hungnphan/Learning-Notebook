# Mapping
- HD map: high definition map, cm level precision.
- ROI: region of interest.
- GNSS: Global Navigation Satellite System, GPS is the most popular GNSS.
- GPS: frequency is about 10 Hz, 1-3 meters precision.
- RTK: Real time kinematics positioning.
- IMU: Inertial Measurement Unit.
    - is used by survey vehicles to map the environment.
    - Accelerometer + gyroscope.
    - high frequency update, up to 1000 Hz.
    - Motion error increases with time. Need to be combined with GPS.
